"""Tier-2: the NURBS geometry classes are core, not IGA-module.

IGA cannot start without a NURBS geometry object. Finding the
class is the first obstacle, and it is not on the IGA module.

Mutation control: T2_MUTATE=1 INVERTS the expected outcome of every probe -- it asserts
the opposite of what this build actually does, while leaving each probe's callable
untouched, so every probe still really runs. Each probe[<label>]=<ok>_expected=<must>
line then disagrees with itself and probe_mismatches rises from 0 to the number of
probes. This is the control the fixture needs: it proves the printed booleans come
from actually calling into Kratos on this build, and that a wrong claim is caught,
rather than the fixture echoing a hard-coded table.
