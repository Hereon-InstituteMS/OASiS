"""FEBio generator registry — maps physics_variant -> generator function.

Mirrors the layout used by skfem, fenics, ngsolve etc.: one file per
FEBio physics module exposes a per-module ``GENERATORS`` + ``KNOWLEDGE``
dict, and this aggregator merges them into the top-level ``GENERATORS``
and ``KNOWLEDGE`` dicts that ``backend.py`` consumes.

When adding a new FEBio physics module (multiphasic, fluid, fluid-FSI,
etc.), drop a new file alongside this one and add it to the imports and
the merge loops below.
